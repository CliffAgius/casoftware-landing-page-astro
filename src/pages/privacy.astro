        <p>
          Similar to other commercial websites, our Website uses a standard
          technology called “cookies” and web server logs to collect information
          about how our Website is being used. A cookie is a small file which
          asks permission to be placed on your computer’s hard drive. Once you
          agree, the file is added and the cookie helps analyse web traffic or
          lets you know when you visit a particular site. Cookies allow web
          applications to respond to you as an individual. The web application
          can tailor its operations to your needs, likes and dislikes by
          gathering and remembering information about your preferences. We use
          traffic log cookies to identify which pages are being used. This helps
          us analyse data about web page traffic and improve our website in
          order to tailor it to customer needs. We only use this information for
          statistical analysis purposes and then the data is removed from the
          system. Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better website, by
          enabling us to monitor which pages you find useful and which you do
          not. A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any
          information about you, other than the data you choose to share with
          us. We use ‘session’ cookies which enable you to carry information
          across pages of the Website and avoid having to re-enter information.
          Session cookies enable us to compile statistics that help us to
          understand how the Website is being used and to improve its structure.
          We also use ‘persistent’ cookies which remain in the cookies file of
          your browser for longer and help us to recognise you as a unique
          visitor to the Website, tailoring the content of certain areas of the
          Website to offer you content that match your preferred interests. This
          explains what we use and how it works:

          You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers
          automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser
          setting to decline cookies if you prefer. Please note that this may
